<p class="cap_1">O but a little consider, and
you will soon find, <i>Pride</i> and
<i>Luxury</i>, <i>Corruption</i> and <i>Bribery</i>,
are the greatest Causes
of our present Calamities;
and if you do not discourage
the Two first, and punish the Two last Evils,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span>
we shall speedily come to Destruction,
and God will blast all our Endeavours.</p>
</div>

<p>The lively Instance of late, proves to us
the <i>Ruin</i> those Evils carry with them: And
is there not one good Man, that dares
to stem the Tide that is come in upon us,
and save us from being drown'd?</p>

<p>Is there not one Man that has <i>Honesty</i>, <i>Interest</i>
or <i>Ability</i>, to put in Practice what is so
necessary to <i>preserve</i> their Country?</p>

<p>Let us shake off then those plaguy Sores
that corrupt our <i>Vitals</i>; and if we intend
to be a Happy and Flourishing People, we
must promote <i>Piety</i>, which admits of no
Corruption; <i>Honesty</i>, that listens to no
Temptation; <i>Sincerity</i>, which never deceives
his Neighbour; <i>Sobriety</i> is the Way to Honour,
and <i>Industry</i> brings Riches, which Frugality
preserves: He therefore that desires
to be <i>truly Great</i>, must possess these Virtues,
and prefer <i>Publick</i> to <i>Private Interest</i>.</p>

<p>What is the Reason that all Inferior Places
of Profit and Trust are <i>bought</i> and
<i>sold</i>, and true Merit wants its <i>Reward</i>? Is
it not because the <i>Devil</i>, when bought,
will be sold?</p>

<p>Are not our Exports of <i>Bullion</i> so great,
that, as fast as it arrives, it goes away?
Which the Publick Entries every Week demonstrate.
And were it not for the daily
Supplies from <i>Portugal</i>, we should have
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span>
nothing but our own <i>Specie</i> to answer all
Demands.</p>

<p>It is obvious, that One Single Corporation
has put us into this Confusion: And
will the <i>Government</i> again trust to <i>that</i>, or
any other? I should not desire a Friend of
mind to be the <i>Adviser</i>.</p>

<p>Can all the Corporations in <i>London</i>, put
together, be so well depended upon, as the
<i>Exchequer</i>; which is supported by the <i>Government</i>,
who are able and willing to make
good all their own Contracts, but are not
answerable for the Losses of any Corporation;
all being oblig'd to sit down and be
content with their own?</p>

<p>Can any Corporation desire more, than
that the <i>Government</i> compel their own Members,
and their Estates, to make good to answer
for their <i>Mismanagement</i>?</p>

<p>Separate then the <i>Standers-by</i> from the
<i>Gamesters</i>, and let the Unconcern'd declare
their Opinion, Whether, in all Corporations,
the <i>Directors</i> have not an unknown
Advantage over all the other Members?
Is it so in the <i>Exchequer</i>?</p>

<p>Tell me then, why a Hundred Pound
in a Corporation, is more valuable than
a Hundred in the <i>Exchequer</i>? Is it not because
you can part with your Property
with much more Ease by way of <i>Transfer</i> in
<i>London</i>? Which is not practis'd at the <i>Exchequer</i>:
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>
Besides, the <i>Transferring</i> is near at
Hand.</p>

<p>The <i>Directors</i> of any Corporation, if not
truly <i>honest</i>, may impose at all Times upon
the rest of the <i>Proprietors</i>, by making a
Dividend above the intrinsick Value of the
Nett Produce of <i>Profit</i>; and the <i>Legislature</i>
would do well to provide against such
Practices for the future.</p>

<p>If due Encouragement was given for the
Importation of <i>Iron</i>, <i>Hemp</i>, <i>Pitch</i> and <i>Tar</i>,
from our own <i>Plantations</i>, the Export of
a great deal of our <i>Bullion</i> would be sav'd,
our <i>Colonies</i> encourag'd, and we should be
then able to supply the <i>Dutch</i>, <i>French</i>,
<i>Spaniard</i>, <i>Italian</i> and <i>Portugueze</i> with Iron,
and bring in Two Hundred Thousand
Pounds <i>per Ann.</i> Balance of Trade.</p>

<p>If the <i>South-Sea</i> Company would trade
to our own Islands, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Bahama</i>, and to
<i>Carolina</i>; that Trade alone would bring
them in Five Hundred Thousand Pounds <i>per
Ann.</i> and with a small Expence, if well
manag'd.</p>

<h2>PROPOSAL</h2>

<h3>To Restore <i>Publick Credit</i>, and Pay<br />
the <i>Nation</i>'s <span class="smcap">Debts</span>.</h3>


<blockquote><p>I. <i>That the</i> South-Sea <i>Company be put in
</i> Statu quo; <i>and if the Estates of the
late</i> Directors, <i>their Aiders and Abettors
will not do it, the</i>  Government <i>to
make up what is wanting.</i></p>

<p>II. <i>That the</i> Subscriptions <i>at</i> Three Hundred,
Four Hundred, Eight Hundred,
<i>and a</i> Thousand, <i>be all paid into the</i>
Exchequer <i>at</i> Two Hundred<i>, and there
to have a Credit for</i> One Hundred<i>;
for which the</i> Government <i>is to pay Ten
</i> per Cent. <i>until the</i> One Hundred <i>shall be
paid off: And that those who have
not paid full</i> Two Hundred<i>, do make
up that Sum within the Time limited
by the late</i> Directors<i>.</i></p>

<p>III. <i>That a Proper Place in</i> London <i>be
appointed to keep a</i> Book<i>, wherein each
Person may be made</i> Debtor <i>and</i> Creditor;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>
<i>and a Duplicate of such</i> Book<i>
to remain in the</i> Exchequer<i>. And that
there may be a</i> Book<i>, wherein every
Person may</i> transfer <i>their Property.</i></p>

<p>IV. <i>The Debt of</i> Seven Millions, Five
Hundred Thousand Pounds<i>, being forgiven
the</i> South-Sea <i>Company, and they
put in</i> Statu quo <i>by the</i> Government<i>;
the</i> Nation <i>will stand</i> Debtor <i>and</i> Creditor<i>

</table>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>The <i>Government</i> is only to pay Ten <i>per
Cent.</i> for the Sum of <i>Twenty Three Millions,
Thirty Thousand, Four Hundred Twenty
Five Pounds</i>. The <i>South-Sea</i> Company being
in <i>Statu quo</i>, are to receive an Interest
as the <i>Act</i> directed before the last <i>Settlement</i>.</p>

<p>The other Moiety will enable the <i>Government</i>
to make good the <i>Deficiency</i> (if
any) to the <i>South-Sea</i> Company, to forgive
them the <i>Seven Millions, Five Hundred
Thousand Pounds</i>, pay the <i>Interest</i> due from
the <i>Government</i> and clear a great Part of
the <i>Principal Debt</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Scheme</i>, as before-mention'd, will restore
our <i>Credit</i>, and pay Part of our <i>Debt</i>;
but if we intend to pay the Remainder, we
must endeavour to be at a <i>Par</i> with our
Neighbours in Trade: And if they outdo
us in Policy therein, and we do not strive
to follow their <i>Methods</i>, we must expect in
the End to be the Losers, and never to have
a Balance.</p>

<p>We ought to consult those Methods that
will increase our <i>Exports</i>, and lessen the <i>Importation</i>
of such Goods as takes away our
<i>Bullion</i>, and prevent our <i>Coin</i> from being
exported, in the best Manner we can.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now, Sir, you having consider'd the
<i>Proposal</i>, and what has been previously
maintain'd give me Leave to ask you a
few Questions: <i>Viz.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>1. Whether the Corporation of the <i>South-Sea</i>
Company, if they could be sure that
the <i>Government</i> would forgive them the
Debt of <i>Seven Millions, Five Hundred
Thousand Pounds</i>, and put them in <i>Statu
quo</i>, (that is, in the Condition they were
in when Stock was at <i>One Hundred Twenty
Five</i>) would not they readily embrace the
<i>Offer</i>?</p>

<p>2. Whether either the <i>South-Sea</i> Company,
the Bank of <i>England</i>, or the <i>East-India</i>
Company, desire the <i>Ingraftment</i> propos'd
by Parliament?</p>

<p>3. Whether a more equal Distribution
of <i>Loss</i> can be made, to please all Parties,
especially the major Part; or who will be
the greatest <i>Loser</i> by the <i>Proposal</i> herein
mention'd?</p>

<p>One great Calamity is the Loss of <i>Paper
Credit</i>, on which our <i>Trade</i> chiefly depended:
We find already a great Decay, which
will soon be more apparent. We have indeed
at present too little <i>Cash</i>, and too little
<i>Credit</i>, to support <i>Trade</i>; and if we
do not take other <i>Methods</i> than what has
been yet practis'd, it will be entirely lost.</p>

<p>It is the Prudence of a <i>Government</i>, to
establish <i>Credit</i> on the most solid Foundation;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>
and what can be so solid as a <i>Parliamentary
Security</i>? Will the <i>Government</i> be
trusted with any future Loans, if their
Debts are settled upon a <i>precarious Bottom</i>?
And are <i>Corporation-Pillars</i> a good Foundation?</p>

<p>The <i>Method</i> already propos'd, is seemingly
calculated for the Service of <i>Stock-Jobbing</i>,
and a Parcel of <i>I know not who</i>,
(<i>Sharpers</i>,) to reap the Benefit of it:
And if so, the <i>Nation</i> will be utterly ruin'd.
For God's Sake, then, let us not run
any more <i>Hazards</i>, but prudently take
such <i>Measures</i> as are most safe and advantageous.</p>

<p>If the <i>Government</i> will forgive the <i>South-Sea</i>
Company the Debt of <i>Seven Millions,
Five Hundred Thousand Pounds</i>, and put
them in <i>Statu quo</i>; they ought to sit
down contented, and be easy and thankful.</p>

<p>If the present <i>Scheme</i> gives the Subscribers
but <i>Twenty Five Pounds</i> Capital Stock
for a <i>Hundred</i>, and the <i>Government</i> will
give such Subscribers <i>Fifty Pounds</i> for a
<i>Hundred</i>, I hope they will have no Reason
to complain.</p>

<p>For should the <i>Subscriptions</i> be ty'd down
to <i>Four Hundred</i>, Thousands of Families
will be ruin'd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>
If we consider the Debt we owe to <i>Foreigners</i>,
and how they, on the <i>Advance
of Stocks</i>, drain us of our Money; we
shall find it very dangerous to suffer <i>Stocks</i>
to be sold above the intrinsick Value.</p>

<p>If Common Interest be reduc'd to Four
<i>per Cent.</i> as was intended; what <i>Proprietor</i>
can say he shall be a Loser? Setting
aside the <i>Subscriptions</i> and <i>Stock</i>, bought
and sold at extravagant Prices; which is
impossible to redress, without making a far
greater Number of Sufferers.</p>

<p>Will the <i>Proposal</i> of Tying down the
<i>Subscribers</i> at <i>Four Hundred</i>, give a
greater Interest than Ten <i>per Cent.</i> for
the Capital? And what will the Capital
be, when paid off? Will that be more than
<i>Twenty Five Pounds</i> for a <i>Hundred</i>? Does
not this <i>Proposal</i> give <i>Fifty Pounds</i> for <i>One
Hundred</i>, with a double Advantage to all;
and at the same Time pays a great Part of
our Debt, and settles our Credit on a solid
Foundation?</p>

<p>A Nation cannot flourish without <i>Virtue</i>;
nor <i>Virtue</i> without <i>good Conscience</i>.
Sudden Ways of <i>growing rich</i>, must be
ruinous to the <i>Publick</i>: There are of late
those who have too suddenly got vast Estates,
and others as soon stripp'd of great Fortunes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>
<i>Industry</i> is therefore the true natural Way
to Wealth, as <i>Idleness</i> is to Poverty. Riches
cannot be honestly got without <i>Industry</i>,
therefore it ought to be encourag'd, and
all <i>idle Persons</i> made to work; and such as
will not work, ought to be serv'd as they
are in <i>Holland</i>, that is, exercis'd with the
<i>Pump</i>.</p>

<p>Has not the easy Way of getting Money
prevented the <i>South-Sea</i> Company from
Carrying on <i>their Trade</i>, and the <i>Fishery</i>,
that Noble and Profitable Branch; which
if they would heartily set their Shoulders
to, they might increase their Stock a Hundred
<i>per Cent.</i> and not set it above its intrinsick
Value? And our <i>Poor</i> being very
numerous, all of 'em may be provided for
that way.</p>

<p>Our <i>Trade</i> has decay'd ever since we
have promoted <i>Stock-Jobbing</i>, that easy
Way of getting Money: Our <i>Manufactories</i>
have diminish'd; which have increas'd
our <i>Poor</i>, and lessen'd our <i>Imports</i> and <i>Exports</i>;
and the King, in Time, will lose
his <i>Customs</i>.</p>

<p>I shall offer some few Heads, necessary
to promote <i>Trade</i>, and to put us in a
Way speedily to pay our <i>Debts</i>, and prevent
<i>Stock-Jobbing</i>, or else <i>Trade</i> can never
flourish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>
We must <i>Recoin</i> our Money, and make
the <i>Agio</i> so large, as will prevent its
being exported; and thereby hinder the
<i>East-India</i> Company from purchasing <i>Bullion</i>
in <i>Holland</i>: For if they are suffer'd to
buy <i>Bullion</i> there, we had better by the
Half give them free Liberty to export our
Coin, unless the <i>Exchange</i> is Eight <i>per Cent.</i>
in our Favour, (which is now so much to
the contrary) we shall at all Times be
Losers. By which it appears, how great
Losers we are at present, by not making
our Coin of a Value, as it may be exported
without Damage to the Nation.</p>

<p>Our <i>Government</i> may have <i>Bullion</i> in
Plenty, if they will be the Merchant for
that Commodity, and give but a small
Matter more for it than our Neighbours;
which we may very well afford to do, if
we settle a like <i>Agio</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>One great Help to <i>Trade</i> in the Nation,
would be to have <i>Sixpences</i> (nay, even
<i>Shillings</i>) coined with a much greater Allay
than our present Coin; as also <i>Groats</i>,
<i>Three-pences</i>, and <i>Twopenny Pieces</i>: The
Government would receive such a Benefit
thereby, as cannot be well here express'd.
And I dare answer to find a <i>Method</i>, with
fine Copper so intermix'd with Silver, that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>
it shall not be worth any Person's Time,
Trouble and Hazard, to counterfeit it.</p>

<p>Our Silver being coined with so great an
<i>Allay</i> as will prevent its being exported,
will in a short Time cause a Currency of
<i>Cash</i>: The <i>Gentry</i> will not hoard it; whereby
<i>Traders</i> will be better paid, and our
<i>Manufactures</i> encourag'd, and carry'd on
to a greater Degree.</p>

<p>I remember when there was a great deal
of <i>Clipt</i> and <i>Counterfeit Money</i>, and very
Plenty of both, that every one that had
either a Counterfeit Piece, or Money that
was cut very small, always studied what to
<i>buy</i> with it, that they might pass the one
away, or part with the other.</p>

<p>The Difference to the <i>East-India</i> Company,
in buying <i>Bullion</i>, or <i>Pieces of Eight</i>,
in <i>Holland</i>, is Seven or Eight <i>per Cent.</i>
more than what it stands them in when
they can be supply'd with it at Home; and
if they were prohibited the <i>Exportation</i> of
<i>Bullion</i> from <i>Foreign Countries</i>, and suffer'd
to export our own <i>Coin</i>, or such Ingots as
shall have the <i>Tower-Mark</i>, our <i>Government</i>
would have the Advantage which the
<i>Dutch</i> now gain, and no Loss to the <i>East-India</i>
Company. For it will be then equally
the same to them, whether they export it
from hence, or from <i>Holland</i>, to <i>India</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>
There is no other Way of preventing
our <i>Bullion</i> and <i>Silver</i> being carry'd out of
the Land, but by the Prohibition of the
one, by paying a Difference to the <i>Government</i>;
<i>viz.</i> such a Difference as comes
pretty near to what is lost by <i>Remittances</i>;
and suffering the other (<i>viz.</i> our <i>Crowns</i>
and <i>Half-Crown Pieces</i>, coin'd with a proportionable
Allay) to be exported. All
which would help to pay off the <i>Nation's
Debts</i>, and make us a Flourishing People.</p>

<p>Our <i>Half-Crowns</i> and <i>Crowns</i> being recoined
to such a Standard, I say, would be
of equal Advantage to the <i>East-India</i> Company,
whether they exported <i>Bullion</i> or
<i>Pieces of Eight</i>, from hence or from <i>Holland</i>:
For by the Bank of <i>Holland</i>, or
rather <i>Amsterdam</i>, all <i>Exchanges</i> are chiefly
govern'd; and as the <i>Hollanders</i> are the
nearest concern'd with us in <i>Trade</i>, so by
them we are to regulate and proportion
the Difference between our <i>Bank-Money</i>
and our Current Cash.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Bank of <i>England</i> is establish'd upon
the Standard of our present <i>Coin</i>: Let
it so remain, till the <i>Government</i> sees fit
to alter, or pay them off; and let <i>Bills of
Exchange</i> be paid <i>in Banco</i>, or, if they so
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>
please, in Current Cash; the Difference or
<i>Agio</i> to be allow'd in like manner as they
do in <i>Holland</i>.</p>

<p>There has been a considerable Profit
made, by <i>Melting down</i> and <i>Exporting</i> our
own Coin; and there will always be those
that will do it, tho' punish'd with Death,
as in <i>Portugal</i>. And where there is a
great Loss in Melting down, or Exporting
the <i>Current Coin</i>, tho' there is no <i>Penalty</i>,
the Money will be preserv'd; as in
<i>Holland</i>.</p>

<p>Let the Merchant have a <i>Profit</i> in
carrying Gold and Silver to the <i>Mint</i> to
be coined, or there will little or none go
there: But if the Merchant finds a <i>Profit</i>
(tho' small) in the Coinage, there will
be great Quantities coined.</p>

<p>That they who act with the greatest
<i>Prudence</i> and <i>Honour</i>, and have most Money,
will always have most Credit; this
needs no Proof.</p>

<p>While our <i>Money</i>, which is the Blood
of the <i>Body Politick</i>, is suffer'd to run out,
and there is no Supply, all <i>Projects</i> for
restoring <i>Credit</i>, and keeping up the Spirits
of the <i>People</i>, will prove abortive.
<i>Trade</i>, and the Noblest Undertakings for
Employing the <i>Poor</i>, must be at a full
Stop, if Money be wanting to carry
them on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>
'Tis certain, that until we have a greater
Plenty of Money, <i>Trade</i> and all other Business
must be assisted with <i>Paper Credit</i>;
and if it does not receive Voluntary Credit,
it will never be made by Force. And
if our Affairs are rightly managed, our
Estates are doubled, and secur'd; if not,
the best Estates will soon be worth nothing.</p>

<p>That <i>Paper Credit</i> may have an immediate
Currency, it is necessary for the <i>Exchequer</i>
to issue out as many <i>Notes</i> as they
shall be able to circulate, with a <i>Tax</i> of a
<i>Guinea</i> on every <i>Transfer</i>; the one Half
to be paid by the <i>Buyer</i>, and the other by
the <i>Seller</i>.</p>

<p>That those <i>Bills</i> be to discharge the
Debts due and owing by the <i>Government</i>:
And that the said <i>Bills</i> be circulated in
<i>London</i>.</p>

<p>Some make a mighty Noise, that if our
<i>Coin</i> be raised, <i>Foreigners</i> will not take it.
I answer, For that Reason we ought to
raise it. If we are to pay <i>Foreigners</i> any
Thing upon the Balance of an Accompt,
we ought to pay them as near as we can in
their own Coin.</p>

<p>That no Person (under severe <i>Penalty</i>)
presume to raise the <i>Price</i> of any Thing,
on Account of the Alteration of the <i>Coin</i>;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>
otherwise the <i>Name</i> is only alter'd, and
not the <i>Value</i> of our Coin: There being
as much Reason for the <i>Parliament</i> to put
a <i>Value</i> thereon, as for a <i>Goldsmith</i> to do it
on wrought Plate.</p>

<p>But the first Care to be taken, is, How
the <i>Nation</i> may prevent any Advance in
<i>South-Sea</i> Stock above what it was before;
so that <i>Foreigners</i> concern'd may not receive
a <i>greater Principal</i> than a Hundred
Pound, and Five <i>per Cent.</i> as they did before
this unhappy <i>Ingraftment</i>: For the
Stock, by the said <i>Ingraftment</i>, will be of
such a Magnitude, that a Hundred <i>per
Cent.</i> Advance will, in all Probability, give
the Strangers such a Capital, as will amount
to more than the whole <i>Cash</i> of
the Kingdom.</p>

<p>The <i>Foreigners</i> have taken an Alarm
since our late <i>unhappy Mismanagement</i>;
and are only waiting for some <i>New Project</i>,
to sell out, and strip us entirely: So
that if we will consider our own <i>Preservation</i>,
we must rather <i>depretiate</i> our Stocks,
than seek Means to <i>augment</i> them.</p>

<p>It is a receiv'd Maxim, <i>Salus Populi Suprema
Lex esto</i>: This I take to be meant
of the <i>whole Body</i>, not of some Parts of
the <i>People</i>. And tho' <i>Thousands</i> may suffer,
yet it is a receiv'd Rule, That the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>
<i>Whole</i> is first to be consider'd, when it
comes in Competition with any <i>Parts</i>.</p>

<p>Therefore, in our present Case, the <i>Whole</i>
is to be consider'd; and the <i>Preservation</i>
of that, is to weigh down against all the
Hardships that may happen to <i>Particulars</i>.</p>

<p>Now, if this Maxim stands good, it is
the Obligation of every true Lover of his
<i>Country</i>, to have that in View; and not,
from a Regard to <i>Particulars</i>, run the Hazard
of sacrificing the <i>Whole</i>. Their <i>Misfortunes</i>
ought to have no Weight, nor any
<i>Contrivance</i> to ease them, prevail, in Balance
with our <i>Country</i>.</p>

<p>Our late <i>Project</i>, if it could have been
held up, would have created such a <i>Luxury</i>,
that that very Thing alone would have
undone the <i>Nation</i>, and would have sunk
us; tho' not with such a <i>Rapidity</i>, as the
Way which we have now in some measure
escap'd.</p>

<hr />

<p>The <i>Matter</i> standing in this Light, the
only View is the <i>Benefit</i> of our <i>Country</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Body Politick</i> is very weak, and requires
an honest and able <i>Physician</i>; and
where to find him, is the only Thing in
Question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>
Let us consider, whether this design'd
<i>Ingraftment</i> of <i>Nine Millions</i> into the <i>Bank</i>,
and <i>Nine Millions</i> into the <i>East-India</i> Company,
will prove any real Benefit to the
<i>Nation</i> as a <i>Nation</i>? No surely, that cannot
be pretended; but only, that they making
greater Dividends, may be of Service
to <i>Individuals</i>; and yet that is much to be
doubted.</p>

<p>For as to the <i>Bank</i>, the Capital was too
big before to render any great <i>Advance</i>:
And had it not been for a new Practice,
first begun by the <i>South-Sea</i> Company, of
Lending Money on their <i>Stock</i>; had it not
been, I say, for their imitating (tho' with
Caution) that <i>infamous Practice</i>, their Dividends
would have been reduc'd to <i>Seven
per Cent.</i> or under.</p>

<p>And for the <i>East-India</i> Company, their
<i>Trade</i> is so far extended, especially at this
Juncture, when they are forc'd to <i>over-trade</i>
themselves, in order to ruin the <i>Ostenders</i>,
that it's look'd on already as a
<i>Grievance</i>: And yet by adding <i>Nine Millions</i>,
they must divide <i>Four Hundred and
Fifty Thousand Pounds</i> Profit more than
before. And notwithstanding their <i>Trade</i>
(as I said before) was then a <i>Grievance</i>;
to what an Extension must it be driven
now, to <i>divide</i> such a Profit; when hitherto
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>
they never <i>divided</i> above <i>One Hundred
and Sixty Thousand Pounds</i> a Year
Profit?</p>

<p>But will it not be a Second <i>Injustice</i> to
the <i>Annuitants</i>, after so great a <i>Diminution</i>
of their Estates, to have <i>Two Thirds</i> of it
<i>ingrafted</i> on a <i>precarious Bottom</i>? All
Stocks having been suffer'd to divide above
the Value of the <i>Nett Produce</i> of their Capital;
a sure Way to distress <i>Trade</i>: Especially
when Corporations are suffer'd to
issue out <i>Bonds</i>, without Trading with the
<i>Money</i>, but purely to advance their <i>Stock</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Two Ingraftments</i> are brought in,
in order to help the <i>Proprietors</i>, by Advantages
of <i>Dividends</i>, to a greater Income
than the Stock could make, if retain'd in
the <i>South-Sea</i>; and so to raise the Nominal
Price of Stock. Whether it will do
the former, is a Doubt; but if so, the
Stock had better been kept where it was;
and if the latter, it will be only a <i>New
Bubble</i>, to ruin us.</p>

<p>Neither the <i>Bank</i>, nor the <i>East-India</i>
Company, seem fond of the Project of this
<i>Ingraftment</i>; and nothing can be argued,
but that Something must be done, at least
to amuse People with <i>vain Hopes</i>: Whereas,
the true Interest of our <i>Country</i> would
have been, to have laid the <i>Wound</i> open
to every one's View; to have shewn the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>
World, what <i>Dividend</i> could be made out
of the <i>Interest</i>, and what they might expect.
Then <i>Foreigners</i> would have sat
still; for they could no where else make
Five <i>per Cent.</i> of <i>One Hundred Pounds</i>; and
their Money have remain'd here.</p>

<p>But if we come to make <i>Dividends</i> of
Twelve <i>per Cent.</i> and by that means advance
the Stock to <i>Three Hundred</i>; then
those Strangers that had <i>Four Millions</i> Capital,
and receiv'd <i>Two Hundred Thousand
Pounds</i> per Ann. will have <i>Four Hundred
and Eighty Thousand Pounds</i> per Annum,
and have a <i>Demand</i> of <i>Twelve Millions</i> on
you; which will entirely finish what the
late <i>South-Sea</i> Directors so gloriously
began.</p>

<p>Is this a Time to endeavour at new <i>Projects</i>,
when the Nation is at so low an
Ebb; and when the World is ready, on the
least Opportunity given, to put to the <i>Finishing
Stroke</i>?</p>

<p>It is a certain Topick, That every <i>Relief</i>
in the Case of the <i>South-Sea</i> Company,
will be thought an <i>Injustice</i> to some, who
cannot be reliev'd but at the <i>Expence</i> of
others. That Way therefore must be taken,
that is most Safe and Equal.</p>

<hr />

<p>By what has been said, you will easily
judge, how little the <i>poor Sufferers</i> are
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>
like to expect from this <i>New Project</i>; and
that if the <i>Success</i> attend it that some People
hope, it must be the Ruin of the
<i>Nation</i>.</p>

<p>You likewise see the <i>Danger</i> there is
in <i>Advancing</i> of Stocks above their Original
Capital; and how necessary it is to
restrain Corporations from <i>Dividing</i> more
than what their <i>Original Stock</i> will fairly
produce; and that such <i>Practices</i> are destructive
to the Commonwealth of this
<i>Nation</i>.</p>

<p>Ought not then the <i>Legislature</i> to enter
upon speedy <i>Measures</i>, and such as may
prevent any <i>Evil Consequence</i> that may
happen?</p>

<hr />

<p>Our Main Business, therefore, is, how
to find out <i>Methods</i> to extend our <i>Trade</i>;
for <i>Projects</i>, and <i>United Companies</i>, are
only contriv'd to <i>enrich</i> a few.</p>

<p>We have within our selves, and in <i>America</i>,
an inexhaustible Fund to <i>supply</i> our
selves, and perhaps <i>Europe</i>, with what we
are now beholden to <i>Foreigners</i> for, and
that at the Expence of our <i>Silver</i> and
<i>Gold</i>; and yet either our <i>Negligence</i>, or
<i>private Views</i>, make us sit still. But otherwise,</p>

<p>What <i>prodigious Advantage</i> would it be
to the <i>Nation</i>, to have a <i>Supply</i> from our
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span>
own <i>Colonies</i> with those <i>Naval Stores</i>,
which we have now from <i>Denmark</i>, <i>Sueden</i>
and <i>Muscovy</i>; and to save the Expence
of so much <i>Money</i> as those Trades
cost us, and no longer to be at the Mercy
of any <i>Foreign Prince</i>? And could we gain
a Balance of <i>Trade</i>, we may hope to retrieve
our selves from all the <i>Difficulties</i> we
seem to labour under. But at present, we
have not the Balance with any one Nation,
except <i>Portugal</i>.</p>

<p>Now if this be the Case, it cannot be
thought that an <i>Over-Balance</i> there, can
answer the <i>Balance</i> that all <i>Europe</i> has
against us.</p>

<p>But Luxury in the Use of <i>Foreign Importations</i>
being discourag'd, we may reasonably
expect to have a <i>Flourishing Trade</i>,
which will bring Mines of <i>Gold</i> and <i>Silver</i>
into our Coffers; all other Arts and Schemes
having no <i>Foundation</i>, and nothing but <i>Destruction</i>.</p>

<p>That <i>Foreigners</i> take the Advantage of
us, by the <i>Rising</i> and <i>Falling</i> of our <i>Stocks</i>;
nor can the <i>Evil</i> be remedied, but by fixing
them down at a <i>certain Price</i> that they
shall be bought or sold; <i>viz.</i> <i>Bank</i>-Stock
at <i>One Hundred and Twenty Five</i> per Cent.
And for that Sum, the said Corporation
may divide <i>Common Interest</i>, but never
more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>
That the Surplus of <i>Profit</i> be, to make
good the Value of <i>One Hundred and Twenty
Five Pounds</i>, at the Time the said <i>Bank</i>
shall be paid off by the <i>Government</i>.</p>

<p><i>India</i> Stock at <i>One Hundred and Twenty
Five</i> per Cent. And that Corporation never
to <i>divide</i> more than <i>Common Interest</i>
for that Sum: The Remainder of <i>Profits</i>
accruing by that Trade be, for the better
<i>Maintenance</i> of their <i>Factories</i>, and the Extending
of their <i>Trade</i> in <i>India</i>.</p>

<p><i>South-Sea</i> Stock at <i>One Hundred and
Twenty Five</i> per Cent. (if the said Corporation
be put in <i>Statu quo</i>) that the
said Corporation may never <i>divide</i> more
than <i>Common Interest</i>: The Remainder to
carry on a Trade to such Parts and Places,
as shall be thought most advisable, and to
establish <i>Colonies</i> for the Good of the Kingdom
in general. Or otherwise, <i>Trade</i> and
<i>Industry</i> will be discourag'd, and <i>Luxury</i>
and <i>Idleness</i> be our Ruin.</p>

<hr />

<p>The <i>Hollanders</i> are more Political in
<i>Trade</i> than we; and they being so near
us, and we having with each other so
great a <i>Trade</i>, and they so largely in our
<i>Stocks</i>, that unless we have an <i>Agio</i> settled,
as they have, (that is, that there be a <i>Difference</i>
between the Current Cash and the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>
<i>Bank</i>-Money) we shall never preserve our
Coin. Nor will Trade ever <i>flourish</i>, or Credit
<i>revive</i>, unless a Liberty be given to all
<i>Bodies Corporate</i> and <i>Collective</i> to Transfer
as usual.</p>

<hr />

<p>As the Eyes of all are upon the Parliament
of <i>Great Britain</i>, greedily expecting
a speedy <i>Settlement</i> of <i>South-Sea</i> Stock;
how easy is it, and how securely may the
<i>House of Commons</i> pass a Vote, That the
<i>Losses</i> of the <i>South-Sea</i> Company shall be
made good? For at present the <i>Stock</i> is
precarious.</p>

<p>And the same may be said, in some Measure,
both of the <i>East-India</i> Company, and
the <i>Bank</i>: Which strengthens the <i>Reasons</i>
against the <i>Government</i>'s trusting any more
to <i>Corporation Credit</i>.</p>

<p>That <i>Trade</i> cannot easily extend it self
in this Kingdom, unless all Corporations
are ty'd down from <i>Dividing</i> (I say) more
than <i>Common Interest</i>. Persons will never
go on to encourage <i>Trade</i>, so long as a
Profit can be made by the frequent <i>Rise</i>
and <i>Fall</i> of Stocks, the Bane of all <i>Industry</i>.</p>

<p>That unless, I say, a Liberty be given
to all <i>Bodies Corporate</i> or <i>Collective</i>, to raise
Money to carry on and extend the <i>Trade</i>
of this Kingdom, can it be thought that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>
<i>Trade</i> will ever increase? And without
Liberty be given to all <i>Bodies Corporate</i>
and <i>Collective</i>, to have a <i>Book</i>, wherein
every Person may <i>transfer</i> their Properties,
such <i>Bodies</i> will be never able to raise Money
to carry on a <i>Trade</i>, or extend it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before I conclude, I shall enlarge a little
concerning the <i>Poor</i> of our Country; who
will never be brought to Labour, so long
as they are maintain'd by the <i>Parish</i>, and
suffer'd to beg about the Country, or in
the Streets.</p>

<p>If <i>proper Places</i> were provided, on <i>Navigable
Rivers</i>, where Land is reasonable;
with good Management, and by the Improvement
of those <i>Lands</i>, the Expence
of our <i>Poor</i> would not be so great by the
one Tenth Part of what it is, and what
we now pay towards their <i>Relief</i>. And
by such a prudent Management, what an
<i>inestimable Benefit</i> would it be to this
Nation; not only by easing the Subject
from that <i>heavy Burthen</i> or <i>Tax</i> to the
<i>Poor</i>, but by the many other <i>Advantages</i>
that thereby the <i>Publick</i> will receive, besides
the many Hands that may be employ'd
to Profit, more than what is necessary
to be appointed for their own and <i>their
Maintenance</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>
Such an <i>Advantage</i> would it be to the
<i>Nation</i>, as would be better to us than the
Mines of <i>Peru</i> and <i>Mexico</i> to the <i>Spanish</i>
Monarchy. It would introduce <i>Industry</i>,
reduce <i>Idleness</i> and <i>Luxury</i>; encourage and
promote the <i>Trade</i> of the Kingdom, increase
our <i>Exports</i>, and lessen our <i>Imports</i>;
by providing of Hands useful in making
all Sorts of Utensils, for <i>Army</i> and
<i>Navy</i>, <i>Soldiers</i> and <i>Sailors</i>, that, when their
Country have no Service for them, they
may return to their <i>Livelihood</i> they were
bred to, and by their <i>honest Industry</i> find a
<i>Maintenance</i>.</p>
